# Day24 we learned about parameters and arguments. We created a function called rollDice that takes a parameter called sides. The function generates a random number between 1 and the number of sides on the die. We also learned about while loops and how to use them to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met. In this case, we used a while loop to keep rolling the dice until the user decides to stop.
